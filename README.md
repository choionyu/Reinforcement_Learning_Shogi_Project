### This is a shogi project using reinforcement learning.
###The structure and methodology of the model for reinforcement learning are deppind's alpha zero and It's the same.
###Due to hardware limitations, the model's learning is not complete yet, but we will try many things in the future.
###We unveil our Shogi project for those who study and learn reinforcement learning.
